# Live-Traffic-Signboard-Detection-and-Driver-Alert-System
Live Traffic Signboard Detection using object detection and voice alert system using machine Learning

This model can detect 42 traffic sign boards and give voice alerts to the driver in real time. The dataset used is from the German traffic signboard dataset.
this system uses YOLO for object detection. It detects sign boards from live video.
This sign board is identified by  using a Convolutional neural network.


Steps:
1. Download all the files in  the repo.
2. Open the python file from the list of files.
3. Change all file locations from the code and update it.
4. run the cells using Jupyter Notebook.
5. Webcam will turn  on and start recording.
